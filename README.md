# Reproducing a graph: Hurricane effects on stream chemistry
This project is a recreation of figure 3 from Schaefer et al. (2000) investigating the effects of Hurricane Hugo on water chemistry in four streams in Bisley, Puerto Rico.

## How to access data

The data is available through the Environmental Data Initiative <https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=knb-lter-luq.20.4923064> from the USDA Forest Service.

## How the analysis works
In order to replicate figure 3 from Schaefer et al. 2000, I first imported the raw data and changed column titles. Following cleaning the data, I filtered the data by stream site and by the time frame of the study. After this process, I joined the stream data into one dataset. The figure visualized the average of stream nutrient concentrations over a time window of 9-weeks for six years. In order to reflect this in the data, we produced a function that inputs concentration and dates and returns a column with the average concentrations. Finally, the stream water chemistry data was plotted as a line graph.
