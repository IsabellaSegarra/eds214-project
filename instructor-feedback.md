# Exceeds spec

**NOTE:** The two exceeds spec have to come from separate learning objectives

## The code is appropriately commented
I think the comments on my code are well organized and explain thoroughly the code segments to the best of my knowledge. I referenced the repositories referenced in class to see how other people comment their code. 

## The README includes a flowchart and text explaining how the analysis works
I think my readme includes a flowchart that depicts my workflow thoroughly and is able to be understood by people outside of this project. 

# Collaboration

I peer reviewed Melannie's work and Marie peer reviewed my work. During my peer review, I was throughouly impressed with Melannie's work and only created Issues with minor work. For instance, I felt that Melannie could have expanded more on the functionality language of the rolling mean function (see here: https://github.com/mmorenorolon/hurricane-streams/issues/14#issue-3364727419). This was also the part of the collaboration that I edited in my own forked repo of her project.

# Instructor feedback

## Automate

[M] **Running the entire analysis requires rendering one Quarto document**

[M] The analysis runs without errors

[M] **The analysis produces the expected output**

[M] **Data import/cleaning is handled in its own script(s)**

## Organize

[M] Raw data is contained in its own folder

[M] Intermediate outputs are created and saved to a separate folder from raw data

[NY] **At least one piece of functionality has been refactored into a function in its own file**

- The R/ directory should include function definitions _only_. Anything besides a function definition (reading data, calling functions, writing outputs) should got in an R script in a different location.

## Document

[M] The repo has a README that explains where to find (1) data, (2) analysis script, (3) supporting code, and (4) outputs

[E] **The README includes a flowchart and text explaining how the analysis works**

- Your README is very professional. It has all the information a collaborator would want to see without any fluff. Well formatted, too!

[M] **The code is appropriately commented**

[M] **Variable and function names are descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention**

## Scale

After cloning the repo on Workbench:

[M] Running the environment initialization script installs all required packages

[M] The analysis script runs without errors

## Collaborate

[M] **The student has provided attentive, constructive feedback in a peer review**

[M] **The student has contributed to a peer's repo by opening an issue and creating a pull request**

[M] The repo has at least three closed GitHub issues

[M] The commit history includes at least one merged branch and a resolved merge conflict

[M] The rendered analysis is accessible via GitHub Pages
